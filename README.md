<h3> About this project </h3>
<p> This is a program that allows you to download videos from YouTube (youtube.com) in the mp4 file format. The pytube module is imported for this purpose </p>
<p> The user can choose to enter the link to the video or search for the video using the in-built YouTube search function to search for a video. The link is then retrieved from there and the video is downloaded using the link retrieved. </p>
<p> This project is inspired by the many different YouTube downloaders out in the web. This allows users to watch YouTube videos without watching any advertisements and also for users to save any video they may find interesting which may be removed after a while. </p>
<p> Some examples of other YouTube downloaders include y2mate and savetonet. However, some of these sites may contain viruses that may infect your computer. This project is made using a python module which has been tested and no viruses have been detected.</p>

<h3> Installation of module </h3>
<p> To install the modules used by this code, install the following modules by entering them into your shell or command prompt: </p>
```python
pip install pytube
pip install youtube-search
pip install colorama
